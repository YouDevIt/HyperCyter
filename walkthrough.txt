
IMPORTANT
I was too "creative" in designing the navigation system.
Moving from a room to another requires to choose
among "right", "left" and "back", but the outcome
depends on the room you come from, so it's very
confusing without drawing a map. To figure out the
connections is a puzzle per se, but if you are in a
hurry (as probably you are if you're reading this
walkthrough), I track here a possible course.
However you can visit the rooms in other orders,
if you like orienteering, and complete the secondary
missions in the order that you prefer.
